A basic 3D scene create using OpenGL to demonstrate knowledge of various rendering techniques.

It covers the use of vertex buffer objects as well as the importance of vertex array objects to minimise the impact of state changes between draw calls.

Basic shaders are used to demonstrate different materials and lighting effects.

A perspective camera is used that can be controlled with the W, A, S, D keys, with a preset camera position able to be toggled with the C key.

Some objects in the scene are also animated using transformations
